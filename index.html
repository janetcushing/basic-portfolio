        <p>Hello and Welcome to my Website! I am Janet Cushing, a Software Developer from Stratham, New Hampshire. I have 24
            years of back end software development experience, and now I am learning front end development to complement
            my existing skills.
        </p> <br>
        <p>My husband, Tim, is a Software Architect. We met at work, many moons ago. We have 3 children named Danielle, Alex and
            Kasey, and a cat named Marley. Kasey lives in Georgetown, Delaware; Alex lives in Newmarket, New Hampshire; Danielle lives in
            Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.  Marley is the only one still living at home!
        </p> <br>
        <p>When I am not working, I like to hang out at the lake, hike, ski, read, or travel. This year my husband and I traveled
            to China and Vietnam. It was a fantastic trip! We went to Beijing, Xiâ€™an and Shanghai in China; Ho Chi Minh
            City (Saigon), the Mekong Delta, Da Nang and Hoi An in Vietnam. While we were in Vietnam, we were able to visit
            with our daughter, Danielle, who lives there.
        </p> <br>
